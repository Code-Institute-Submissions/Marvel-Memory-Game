The game has been created for pleasure and entertainment for all ages. Using images pulled from Marvel API, the game allows 'players/    Marvel fans' match two cards of the same character image making a pair. the aim is to complete before the timer reaches 0.
 
## UX

The game has been designed to be as intutive and user friendly as possible with an retro feel for enjoyment for all ages. It allows for the user to 'look' for matching pairs of some of their favorite Marvel characters. On loading of the game a 'click to start' overlay appears with the pre text 'Find the matching pairs'. On clicking of the overlay the game starts and the count down timer starts as well as the background music. If all pairs are matched within the time an overlay with 'You won!' & 'click to restart' appears else a 'Game Over' overlay and 'click to restart' text appears if time runs out.

## Technologies Used

The game has been built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. For responsive layout on smaller screens, CSS' grid system was used to make the game proptionally correct. However smaller screens are not optimal for gaming pleasure. Images were sourced from [Marvels Dev Portal](https://developer.marvel.com/) and fonts form [fontspace.com](https://www.fontspace.com/category/marvel).
[JQuery](https://jquery.com/) was used to show my understanding of the library and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for ease of layout with some elements.
